# 📌 What is Section 54F?

**Section 54F** provides an exemption from **long-term capital gains (LTCG)** arising from the sale of **any capital asset other than a residential house**, provided the **sale proceeds are invested in one residential house property in India**.

---

## ✅ Covered Assets
- Equity shares  
- Mutual funds  
- Bonds  
- Gold  
- Land or commercial property  

❌ **Not applicable** if the sold asset itself is a **residential house**  
(that case falls under **Section 54**).

---

## 🎯 Why does Section 54F exist?

The primary objective of Section 54F is to:

- Encourage investment in residential housing  
- Help individuals convert financial assets into real estate  
- Reduce the tax burden on long-term investors  
- Support first-time or upgrader homebuyers  

**In short:** the government rewards taxpayers who reinvest long-term gains into housing.

---

## 👤 Who can claim Section 54F exemption?

Section 54F is available only to:
- **Individuals**
- **Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs)**

### Additional Ownership Condition
On the **date of sale of the original asset**, the taxpayer **must not own more than one residential house**  
(excluding the new house being purchased).

---

## ⏳ When can the exemption be claimed?

Timing is crucial under Section 54F.

### Purchase / Construction Window

| Mode | Time Limit |
|-----|----------|
| Buy a ready house | 1 year **before** or 2 years **after** sale |
| Construct / under-construction house | Within 3 years **after** sale |

✅ Capital gains from **multiple sales** can be adjusted against **one house**, provided each sale falls within the permitted window.

---

## 📍 Where must the investment be made?

- The new residential house **must be located in India**

### Investment can be made through:
- Own funds  
- Home loan  
- Combination of loan + capital gains  

💡 The law **does not require exact sale proceeds** to be used.

---

## ⚙️ How does Section 54F exemption work?

### 1️⃣ Full Exemption
If:
- **Cost of new house ≥ Net sale consideration**

➡️ Entire capital gain is exempt

---

### 2️⃣ Partial Exemption
If:
- **Cost of new house < Net sale consideration**

➡️ Exemption is proportionate

**Formula:**


---

## 🏦 Can Section 54F be claimed if the house is bought using a home loan?

✅ **Yes. Absolutely.**

- Source of funds is **irrelevant**
- Even if the house is **fully funded by a home loan**, exemption is available

Equity sale proceeds can be:
- Used later to repay EMIs  
- Used for down payment  
- Invested after purchase (within timelines)  

👉 What matters is the **cost of the house**, not cash flow matching.

---

## 🔁 Can Section 54F be claimed multiple times?

✅ **Yes**, subject to conditions:

- Each capital gain transaction must independently meet timelines  
- Ownership condition must be satisfied **on each sale date**  
- Overall **₹10 crore exemption cap** applies  
  *(introduced from FY 2023–24 onwards)*

---

## ⚠️ Important Conditions & Traps to Avoid

🚫 **Exemption will be withdrawn if:**
- You buy another residential house within 2 years  
- You construct another house within 3 years  
- You sell the new house within 3 years  

🚫 **Capital Gains Account Scheme (CGAS)** is required if:
- Sale proceeds are not utilized before the return filing due date

---

## 🧮 Quick Example

- Equity shares sold: **₹80 lakh**  
- LTCG: **₹40 lakh**  
- House purchased for: **₹75 lakh**

**Exemption:**

**Taxable LTCG:** ₹2.5 lakh

---

## 🏁 Final Takeaway

Section 54F is one of the **most powerful tax-saving tools** for investors planning to buy a home using long-term equity gains.

With proper planning around:
- Timelines  
- Ownership rules  
- Investment value  

👉 You can significantly reduce—or even eliminate—capital gains tax.

**The key is planning *before* selling, not after.**
