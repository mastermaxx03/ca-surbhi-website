summary: >+
  Gold and silver are not just ornaments or traditional assets in India—they are
  widely used as long-term investment options. While tracking price movements is
  important, understanding the tax implications of investing in gold and silver
  is equally critical. Incorrect timing or lack of tax awareness can
  significantly reduce post-tax returns.

## WHAT: How Are Gold and Silver Taxed?

The taxation of gold and silver in India depends on two key factors:

- **Type of investment**
- **Holding period**

---

## GST on Purchase

| Investment Type | GST Applicable |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Physical gold, physical silver, digital gold | **3% GST** |
| Gold jewellery | **3% GST on gold value + 5% GST on making charges** |

> **Important:** GST paid at the time of purchase **cannot be adjusted or set off** against capital gains tax at the time of sale.

---

## Capital Gains Tax on Sale

### Physical Gold, Silver & Jewellery

| Holding Period | Tax Treatment |
|----------------|---------------|
| Up to **24 months** | **Short-Term Capital Gain (STCG)** – taxed as per income tax slab |
| More than **24 months** | **Long-Term Capital Gain (LTCG)** – taxed at **12.5% (without indexation)** |

---

### Gold & Silver ETFs and Mutual Funds

| Holding Period | Tax Treatment |
|----------------|---------------|
| Up to **12 months** | **STCG** – taxed as per income tax slab |
| More than **12 months** | **LTCG** – taxed at **12.5%** |

---

### Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs)

- **2.5% annual interest**: Fully taxable as per the investor’s income tax slab  
- **Redemption at 8-year maturity**: **Capital gains are completely tax-free**  
- **Sale before maturity (on exchange)**: Capital gains tax applies based on holding period  

---

## WHY: Why Holding Period Matters

The holding period plays a decisive role in determining tax liability.

Selling gold or silver **even one day before completing the required long-term holding period** can convert LTCG into STCG—leading to a significantly higher tax outgo.

**Example:**  
On a profit of **₹2 lakh**, premature selling can result in **₹35,000+ extra tax**, depending on the investor’s income slab.

---

## WHO: Who Should Be Concerned?

These tax rules apply to:

- Individual investors and **HUFs**
- Investors holding:
  - Physical gold or silver
  - Jewellery
  - Digital gold
  - Gold and silver ETFs or mutual funds
  - Sovereign Gold Bonds

Both **short-term traders** and **long-term investors** must factor taxation into their investment strategy.

---

## WHERE: Applicability of These Rules

- Applicable **across India**
- Governed by:
  - **Income-tax Act**
  - **GST laws**
- Uniformly applicable to resident investors, subject to future amendments by the government

---

## WHEN: When Is Tax Payable?

- **At purchase**: GST is charged immediately  
- **At sale or redemption**: Capital gains tax becomes applicable  
- **At SGB maturity**: No capital gains tax (if held till maturity)

---

## HOW: How Investors Can Save Tax Under Section 54F

Long-term capital gains from gold or silver can be **partially or fully exempt** by reinvesting under **Section 54F** of the Income-tax Act.

### Key Rule
To claim **full exemption**, the **entire sale consideration** (not just the capital gain) must be reinvested in **one residential house property in India**.

### Proportionate Exemption Formula


### Time Limits

- **Purchase of property**:
  - 1 year before or 2 years after the sale
- **Construction of property**:
  - Within 3 years of sale
- **Unutilised amount**:
  - Must be deposited in the **Capital Gains Account Scheme (CGAS)** before filing the income tax return

> Certain ownership conditions apply, including restrictions on owning multiple residential houses.

---

## Final Takeaway

Gold and silver can be effective tools for **wealth preservation**, but actual returns depend not just on market prices—**tax planning and timing matter just as much**.  
A clear understanding of **GST**, **capital gains rules**, and **exemptions like Section 54F** can help investors maximise post-tax returns and avoid costly mistakes.
